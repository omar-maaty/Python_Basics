# 🐍 Python Basics Journey

Welcome to my Python Basics repository! This collection represents my transition from learning syntax to building functional scripts.

Here, I apply core computer science concepts using Python, focusing on logic building, data manipulation, and clean coding practices **before** moving to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🎯 Objective
To master the fundamentals of Python, including:
- **Control Flow:** Loops, Conditionals, and Exception Handling (`try/except`).
- **Data Structures:** Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets.
- **File Handling:** Reading, writing, and parsing text/data files.
- **Algorithms:** Basic sorting, searching, and logic implementation.

## 📂 Projects List

| # | Project Name | Key Concepts Applied | Status |
|:-:|:------------|:---------------------|:------:|
| 1 | **Text Analyzer** | File I/O, Dictionaries, Frequency Counting, String Methods | ✅ Completed |
| 2 | **Guessing Game** | `random` lib, Logic Building, Data Persistence (High Score) | ✅ Completed |
| 3 | **Password Manager** | Functions, Data Parsing (`split`), Context Managers (`with`), Appending Files | ✅ Completed |
| 4 | **To-Do List App** | CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Delete), List Manipulation (`pop`), Error Handling | ✅ Completed |

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Tools:** VS Code / PyCharm, Git & GitHub

## 📚 Learning Resource
This journey is inspired by the **"Python for Everybody"** specialization by the University of Michigan (Dr. Charles Severance).
