# 🐍 Python Basics Journey

Welcome to my Python Basics repository! This collection represents my transition from learning syntax to building functional scripts.

Here, I apply core computer science concepts using Python, focusing on logic building, data manipulation, and clean coding practices **before** moving to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🎯 Objective
To master the fundamentals of Python, including:
- **Control Flow:** Loops, Conditionals, and Exception Handling (`try/except`).
- **Data Structures:** Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets.
- **File Handling:** Reading, writing, and parsing text/data files.
- **Algorithms:** Basic sorting, searching, and logic implementation.

## 📂 Projects List
*(I will update this list as I complete the projects)*

| # | Project Name | Key Concepts Applied | Status |
|:-:|:------------|:---------------------|:------:|
| 1 | **Text Analyzer** | File I/O, Dictionaries, String Manipulation | 🚧 In Progress |
| 2 | *Coming Soon...* | ... | ⏳ Pending |
| 3 | *Coming Soon...* | ... | ⏳ Pending |
| 4 | *Coming Soon...* | ... | ⏳ Pending |
| 5 | *Coming Soon...* | ... | ⏳ Pending |

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Tools:** VS Code / PyCharm, Git & GitHub

## 📚 Learning Resource
This journey is inspired by the **"Python for Everybody"** specialization by the University of Michigan (Dr. Charles Severance).
